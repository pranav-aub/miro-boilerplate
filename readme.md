Boilerplate project already includes:

- TypeScript
- Webpack
- ReactJS

## How to use:

- change the `subdomain` inside [`webpack.config.js`](./webpack.config.js) (default is your machine `hostname`)

```
/* ----------------- CHANGE THIS -------------------------*/
const subdomain =  ''
/* ----------------- CHANGE THIS -------------------------*/
```

- Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start developing, you should have a URL that looks like this

> First time you open the URL you will see a page from [localtunnel](https://loca.lt/) asking you to click continue.
> This check will happen every 7 days per domain. Feel free to remove localtunnel if you want. But you have to serve your app over https, that's a requirement.

```
https://<subdomain>.loca.lt
```

- Paste the URL in `web-plugin url` in your app settings
- open a board & you should see your app in the main toolbar when you click the
  three dots.

## How to build the app:

Run `npm run build` or `yarn run build`
